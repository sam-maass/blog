As someone who values productivity and organization, I have developed the habit of conducting a daily debrief at the end of each day. This simple yet powerful practice has helped me stay on track with my goals and objectives, and has allowed me to reflect on my progress and learn from my experiences.

I have created a template in Mem for my daily debrief, which helps me stay consistent and ensures that I am covering all of the important points.

At the end of each day, I take a few minutes to jot down some notes about how I approached my goals and objectives over the course of the day. This helps me stay focused on what's important and ensures that I am making progress towards my long-term goals.

In addition to noting my progress on my goals and objectives, I also make a point to write down three good things that happened during the day. This can be anything from a positive interaction with a friend or colleague, to completing a task that I had been putting off. Writing down these positive experiences helps me maintain a positive outlook and keeps me motivated to continue working towards my goals.

I also take the time to write down three things that I have learned during the day. This could be anything from a new skill or technique, to a lesson about myself or my work. By keeping track of what I am learning, I am able to continue growing and improving as an individual.

Finally, I make a note of any unfinished tasks or projects that I need to carry over to the next day. These tasks will either be handled the following day or I will move them to Todoist for future reference. This ensures that I am able to pick up where I left off, and helps me stay organized and on top of my workload.

Overall, my daily debrief has been an incredibly valuable habit for staying focused and organized. I highly recommend giving it a try if you are someone who values productivity and organization.
