      <h1>Hi, I'm Sam</h1>
      <h2>Engineering Manager by day, Fullstack JS Developer by night.</h2>
      <p>
        I love building things for the web and am always looking for new challenges to tackle. On
        this website, you'll find a bit about my background, what I'm passionate about, and some of
        my recent projects.
      </p>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>
        I've been in the tech industry for a while now and have had the opportunity to work on a
        variety of projects. From developing e-commerce websites to founding my own startup, I've
        gained a diverse set of skills and experiences. Currently, I'm an Engineering Manager, but I
        still enjoy getting my hands dirty with coding on the side.
      </p>
      <h3>Passionate About</h3>
      <p>
        When I'm not busy with work, I love talking about and learning about coding, especially with
        JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue. I'm also a big fan of travel and love exploring
        new places and cultures. In addition, I'm always on the lookout for interesting startups to
        follow and invest in. And last but not least, I'm a bit of a history buff and love learning
        about old maps and their significance.
