# Welcome to My Personal Website and Blog

This is the GitHub repository that contains the code for my personal website and blog, which is built using [Astro](https://astro.build/), a modern and powerful JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.

Before you can run the scripts mentioned below, you will need to install the necessary dependencies by running `npm install` in the root directory of the repository. This will install the Astro.js framework and any other required packages listed in the `package.json` file.

To run the website locally, you can use the `dev` or `start` scripts, which will start a development server on your local machine.

To build a production-ready version of the website, you can use the `build` script, which will generate a optimized version of the website in the `build` directory.

To preview the built website, you can use the `preview` script, which will start a local development server with the built version of the website.

In addition to these scripts, there is also the `astro` script, which allows you to use the Astro.js command-line interface to perform various tasks.

On my blog, you'll find posts on a variety of topics, ranging from personal experiences and thoughts, to tutorials and discussions on the latest technologies.

Thank you for visiting my website. I hope you enjoy reading my posts!
